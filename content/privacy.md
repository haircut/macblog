## Privacy policy

I respect your privacy. This website does not collect any information from
visitors, nor does it attempt to track you or collect analytics when you visit.

**MacBlog.org** does not collect any data, so there's nothing I could share with
or sell to a third party.

## Terms of service

You do not have to agree to any terms of service in order to access, view, read,
or copy any of the content on this website.

All content on **MacBlog.org** is [licensed under Creative Commons

## Analytics

**MacBlog.org** is hosted by [Cloudflare][cloudflare]. Cloudflare provides an
"[account analytics][cfanalytics]" feature that displays aggregated metrics
including the number of visitors (unique IPs) accessing all websites under my
Cloudflare account.

**MacBlog.org does not use** [Cloudflare's Web Analytics][cfwa] product, which
is a distinct _Real User Monitoring_ product.

Effectively, I can see how many people visit this website in a given time
period, but no detail about who they are or even which specific pages they load.

Please see the
[Cloudflare Privacy Policy][cfpp] for details about what information their
infrastructure may collect.

I do not subscribe to Netlify's "Analytics" feature.
